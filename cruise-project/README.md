 ## Cruise-project

 ### In modern agile software development practice, there is a development practice called "Continuous Integration (CI)",which requires any time, any place can generate a deployable version. Usually in the actual development, the developerto the code library to push the code, will automatically trigger a series of actions, including code checking, compiling,running testing, packaging. These steps are run through automated scripts to a group of servers, and we want to create a product such as CRUISE that can easily manage these servers, monitor or set their status.
